        <h2>Fish</h2>
        <p>Strictly speaking, the fish design is a short, wide, swallow tail twin-fin, no more than six feet in length and at least 21 inches wide. Popularized in the ‘70s as a new alternative to the single fin shortboard, the fish continues to hold value to surfers because of its single greatest attribute: speed.</p>

        <p>- Pros: Catch waves easily
Performs well in weak/small surf

          <h2>Funboard</h2>
          <p>Funboards are the result of a rising demand for surfboards that are easily accessible to the average surfer. They combine the paddling power of a longboard with the maneuverability of the shortboard, and are usually about seven to eight feet long and quite thick. Shapes vary from standard longboard outlines to oversized shortboards. Although hybrids are anything but sexy, they are a practical surfboard choice for beginner and intermediate surfers.</p>

            <li>Ability: Progressing beginners to intermediate-advanced riders</li>
            <li>Size range: 6'6" - 8'4"</li>
